Overview
Which Beyonc√©? is a two-player game that replicates Concentration.
Each player takes turn flipping over all the cards until they find all 5 matches. The goal is to find all the matches in a faster amount of time than the opposing player. A winning message is displayed after the game finishes with the name of the winner and the total amount of time in minutes and seconds that it took for the winning player to find all 5 matches.
